<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This offer creates a JBoss EAP VM image with the Red Hat build of OpenJDK on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).</p>

<p>You can use a specific version of JBoss EAP, OpenJDK, and RHEL by selecting a plan such as EAP 7.4 with JDK 17 on RHEL 8.</p>

<p>The VM instance created by this offer is suitable for customers that require very highly customized Azure deployments. You are expected to be familiar with JBoss EAP administration. The relevant directories are listed here:</p>

<ul>
<li>EAP_HOME: /opt/rh/eap7/root/usr/share/wildfly</li>
<li>JAVA_HOME: a subdirectory of /usr/lib/jvm, depending on the selected JDK version</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no pre-created domain controller, host controllers, or server groups. During VM creation, you are asked to provide a username and SSH key or credentials for the admin account. After logging in with this account, become a superuser to get write access to the relevant directories.</p>

<p>For instructions on creating a domain controller, host controllers, and server groups given the above directories visit the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform documentation. Once there, select the appropriate version of JBoss EAP for your VM. Find the document titled "Configuration Guide" and the chapter titled "Domain Management".</p>

<p>In addition to the VM image, Red Hat and Microsoft offer solution templates to meet different scenarios on Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)
such as a standalone JBoss EAP instance or a JBoss EAP cluster. Red Hat and Microsoft also offer a fully managed JBoss EAP solution on App Service. These offers are
linked in the Useful links section at the bottom of the solution overview page.</p>
