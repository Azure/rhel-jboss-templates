<h1>Description</h1>
<p>JBoss EAP is a leading Java application server running some of the most mission-critical enterprise applications in the world. This
   solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision a dynamic JBoss EAP cluster on Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Once initial
   provisioning is complete, you are completely free to customize deployments further. The solution is jointly developed by Red Hat and
   Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>VM Scale Sets (VMSS) based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) images (you can choose the number of instances - all
instances will have private IP addresses)</li>
<li>Azure App Gateway instance with a public IP address (the backend pool will be set to the Scale Set VMs)</li>
<li>JBoss EAP instances on each VM (<strong>EAP_HOME</strong> is <strong>/opt/rh/eap7/root/usr/share/wildfly</strong>).<ul>
<li>Database data source connection if user selects to connect a database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JBoss EAP management console</li>
<li>Red Hat build of OpenJDK on each VM (<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> is a subdirectory of <strong>/usr/lib/jvm</strong>,
depending on the selected JDK version).</li>
<li>Virtual network and subnet (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing virtual network)</li>
<li>Network security group</li>
<li>Storage account for setting up Azure ping protocol for JGroups usage</li>
<li>Storage account to enable boot diagnostics (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>This offer requires a JBoss EAP subscription and works on a Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS) basis. For the RHEL part of the offer,
you have a choice to use either Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) or BYOS. In case of PAYGO, there is an additional hourly RHEL subscription charge for
using this offer on top of the normal Azure compute, network and storage costs.
<i>To use RHEL BYOS, you must <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access">contact Red Hat</a> to get your
subscription enabled on Azure</i>. Once you do so, the RHEL BYOS options will become visible as plans.</p>
<p>Red Hat and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with JBoss EAP and RHEL without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>Red Hat and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting JBoss EAP on single VMs, a static cluster on VMs,
Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and App Service. These options are linked in the <i>Learn more</i> section below.</p>
