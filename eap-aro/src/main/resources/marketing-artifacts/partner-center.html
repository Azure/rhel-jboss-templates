<h1>Description</h1>
<p>JBoss EAP is a leading Java application server running some of the most mission-critical enterprise applications in the world. This
   solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision JBoss EAP on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster. Once initial provisioning
   is complete, you are completely free to customize deployments further. The solution is jointly developed by Red Hat and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ARO cluster (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing ARO cluster)</li>
  <li>JBoss EAP Operator</li>
  <li>Sample getting started application</li>
  <li>Custom application deployment using Source-to-Image (S2I), based on JDK 11 and JBoss EAP 8</li>
  <li>Virtual network and subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>This offer requires a JBoss EAP subscription and works on a Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS) basis. Red Hat and Microsoft also
provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with JBoss EAP and ARO without automated provisioning.</p>
<p>Red Hat and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting Azure Virtual Machines and App Service. These options are linked in the
