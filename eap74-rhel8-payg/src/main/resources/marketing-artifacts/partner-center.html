<p>This offer requires a JBoss EAP subscription and works on a Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS) basis. For the RHEL part of the offer,
you have a choice to use either Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) or BYOS. In case of PAYGO, there is an additional hourly RHEL subscription charge for
using this offer on top of the normal Azure compute, network and storage costs.
<i>To use RHEL BYOS, you must <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access">contact Red Hat</a> to get your
subscription enabled on Azure</i>. Once you do so, the RHEL BYOS options will become visible as plans.</p>
<p>Red Hat and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with JBoss EAP and RHEL without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>Red Hat and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting JBoss EAP on a cluster of VMs, Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) and App Service.
